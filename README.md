# Text-Classification-with-Logistic-Regression

The goal of this project is to develop and test two text classification systems:

Task 1: sentiment analysis, in particular to predict the sentiment of movie review, i.e. positive or negative (binary classification).

Task 2: topic classification, to predict whether a news article is about International issues, Sports or Business (multiclass classification).
